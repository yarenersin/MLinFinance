## Information

*This part is for coders who are new to Machine Learning*

These questions should be answered at first, "What is Machine Learning?, What should I study to learn Machine Learning?, What is Finance?, What is the relationship between Machine Learning and Finance? "

First of all, Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. ML is a method paradigm that makes inferences from existing data using mathematical and statistical methods and makes predictions about what is not known with these inferences.

Secondly, Our favorite programming language is *Python* nowadays for #MachineLearning.[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), [Numpy](https://www.numpy.org/), [Scikit learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) are Python Libraries which are used in Machine Learning.
